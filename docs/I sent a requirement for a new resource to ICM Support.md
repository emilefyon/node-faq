title: I sent a requirement for a new resource to ICM Support. His/her profile doesn’t exist in MyClarity yet.  What can I do?

When ICM Support receives your resource creation demand, a creation request is send to the MyClarity application. A generic resource’s profile in My Clarity is automatically created. The MyClarity resource is completed by ICM Support with the received information. This procedure can take two workdays. 

Then the Performance Management Team completes the detailed information in the resource’s profile in MyClarity (general, financial, administrative, access rights, …)

Several days already passed? Have you well asked an access to MyClarity in your request? If you forgot it re-send a request to ICM Support.
In other case contact the Performance Management Team.
